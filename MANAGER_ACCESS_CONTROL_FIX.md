# Manager Access Control Fix

## Overview
Fixed the authorization system to restrict Managers to their own department only, similar to IT Staff and other department employees. Previously, Managers had access to all departments like Admins.

## Changes Made

### File: `src/utils/departmentAuth.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Admin and Manager users can access any department
if (user.role === 'Admin' || user.role === 'Manager' || userDepartment === 'Admin') {
  return {
    isAuthorized: true,
    errorMessage: null,
    redirectTo: null
  };
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Only Admin users can access any department
// Managers are restricted to their own department
if (user.role === 'Admin' || userDepartment === 'Admin') {
  return {
    isAuthorized: true,
    errorMessage: null,
    redirectTo: null
  };
}
```

## How It Works

### Role-Based Access Control Hierarchy

1. **Admin** - Full access to all departments
   - Can view and manage all department sections
   - All sidebar menu items are enabled

2. **Manager** - Department-specific access (NEW BEHAVIOR)
   - Can only access their own department
   - Other departments are blocked in the sidebar (shown grayed out)
   - Behaves like department staff members
   - Example: IT Manager can only access IT Department

3. **Employee/Staff** - Department-specific access
   - Can only access their own department
   - Other departments are blocked in the sidebar
   - Only see their employee dashboard and own department

### Sidebar Behavior

The sidebar in `MainLayout.fixed.jsx` automatically reflects these permissions:

- **Authorized departments**: Clickable, highlighted when active
- **Unauthorized departments**: Grayed out with tooltip showing "Access Denied" message
- **Dashboard**: Always accessible to all roles

### Department Authorization Flow

1. User logs in → Role and Department stored in user object
2. User tries to access a department → `checkDepartmentAccess()` is called
3. System checks:
   - Is user an Admin? → ✅ Grant access
   - Does user's department match target department? → ✅ Grant access
   - Otherwise → ❌ Deny access

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: IT Manager
- **User**: John (Role: Manager, Department: IT)
- **Can Access**: 
  - ✅ Dashboard
  - ✅ IT Department
- **Cannot Access**:
  - ❌ HR Department (blocked in sidebar)
  - ❌ Sales Department (blocked in sidebar)
  - ❌ All other departments (blocked in sidebar)

#### Scenario 2: IT Staff
- **User**: Sarah (Role: Employee, Department: IT)
- **Can Access**:
  - ✅ Employee Dashboard
  - ✅ IT Department (if they have staff role)
- **Cannot Access**:
  - ❌ All other departments (blocked in sidebar)

#### Scenario 3: Admin
- **User**: Admin (Role: Admin)
- **Can Access**:
  - ✅ All departments
  - ✅ Full system access

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Manager Restricted Access**
   ```
   Login as: Manager in IT Department
   Expected: 
   - Can access IT Department ✅
   - Cannot access HR, Sales, etc. (grayed out) ❌
   - Tooltip shows access denied message
   ```

2. **Admin Full Access**
   ```
   Login as: Admin
   Expected:
   - Can access all departments ✅
   - All menu items are clickable
   ```

3. **Staff Department Access**
   ```
   Login as: IT Staff
   Expected:
   - Can access IT Department ✅
   - Cannot access other departments (grayed out) ❌
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Security**: Managers can no longer access departments they don't manage
2. **Clear Separation**: Each Manager only manages their own department
3. **Consistent UX**: Same blocked sidebar behavior for all non-Admin users
4. **Better Permissions Model**: Follows principle of least privilege

## Migration Notes

If you have existing Managers who rely on full system access:
1. Change their role to "Admin" in the database
2. Or assign them to multiple departments (if you implement multi-department support)
3. Or keep Admin role for cross-department oversight

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. **Multi-Department Access**: Allow Managers to be assigned to multiple departments
2. **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Add specific permissions (read, write, delete) per department
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Create Department Manager vs General Manager roles
4. **Audit Logging**: Track access attempts for compliance
