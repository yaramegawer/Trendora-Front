# Transaction API Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the integration of transaction management APIs into the Accounting Department frontend.

## Backend API Endpoints
All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/accounting`:

- **POST** `/add_transaction` - Create a new transaction
- **PUT** `/update_transaction/:_id` - Update an existing transaction
- **GET** `/get_transactions` - Get all transactions
- **DELETE** `/delete_transaction/:id` - Delete a transaction
- **GET** `/get_transaction/:_id` - Get a single transaction by ID
- **GET** `/summary` - Get accounting summary (revenue, expenses, profit, balance)

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. API Service Layer (`src/services/accountingApi.js`)

Added the following transaction management functions:

#### `addTransaction(transactionData)`
Creates a new transaction with the following fields:
- `description` (string): Transaction description
- `amount` (number): Transaction amount
- `type` (string): Either 'income' or 'expense'
- `method` (string): Payment method - visa, wallet, or cash
- `date` (string): Transaction date in ISO format

**Example:**
```javascript
const result = await accountingApi.addTransaction({
  description: 'Client Payment',
  amount: 5000,
  type: 'income',
  method: 'visa',
  date: '2024-01-15'
});
```

#### `updateTransaction(transactionId, updateData)`
Updates an existing transaction by ID.

**Example:**
```javascript
const result = await accountingApi.updateTransaction('transaction_id', {
  description: 'Updated description',
  amount: 6000
});
```

#### `getAllTransactions()`
Fetches all transactions for the current user.

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: [
    {
      _id: 'transaction_id',
      description: 'Transaction description',
      amount: 5000,
      type: 'income',
      date: '2024-01-15',
      createdAt: '2024-01-15T10:00:00Z'
    },
    // ... more transactions
  ]
}
```

#### `getTransaction(transactionId)`
Fetches a single transaction by ID.

#### `deleteTransaction(transactionId)`
Deletes a transaction by ID.

#### `getSummary()`
Fetches accounting summary with aggregated data.

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    totalRevenue: 125430,
    totalExpenses: 89210,
    netProfit: 36220,
    cashBalance: 245890
  }
}
```

### 2. Custom Hook (`src/hooks/useAccountingData.js`)

Added state management and methods for transactions:

#### State
- `transactions` - Array of transaction objects
- `summary` - Object containing financial summary
- `loading` - Loading state
- `error` - Error messages
- `fieldErrors` - Field-specific validation errors

#### Methods
- `fetchTransactions()` - Loads all transactions
- `addTransaction(data)` - Creates a new transaction
- `updateTransaction(id, data)` - Updates a transaction
- `deleteTransaction(id)` - Deletes a transaction
- `getTransaction(id)` - Gets a single transaction
- `fetchSummary()` - Loads financial summary

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
const {
  transactions,
  summary,
  addTransaction,
  deleteTransaction,
  loading
} = useAccountingData();
```

### 3. UI Component (`src/components/accounting/AccountingDepartment.jsx`)

#### Summary Cards
Updated to display real-time data from the API:
- Total Revenue (from summary API)
- Total Expenses (from summary API)
- Net Profit (from summary API)
- Cash Balance (from summary API)

All values are displayed in Egyptian Pounds (EGP) with proper number formatting.

#### Transaction List
Displays all transactions with:
- Description
- Date (formatted)
- Amount (color-coded: green for income, red for expense)
- Type badge (income/expense)
- Delete button

**Features:**
- Shows loading state while fetching data
- Empty state message when no transactions exist
- Real-time updates after adding/deleting transactions
- Confirmation dialog before deletion

#### Transaction Dialog
Form to create/edit transactions with fields:
- **Description** (required) - Text description of the transaction
- **Amount** (required) - Numeric value (minimum 0)
- **Date** (required) - Date picker with default to today
- **Type** (required) - Dropdown: Income or Expense
- **Payment Method** (required) - Dropdown: Visa, Wallet, or Cash

**Validation:**
- Field-level error display showing errors directly below each field
- Red border on fields with errors
- No form-level summary (errors shown inline only)
- Success notifications

#### Transaction Table View
Displays transactions in a professional table format similar to invoices:
- **Columns**: Description, Amount (color-coded), Type, Method, Date, Actions
- **Pagination**: 
  - Show 5, 10, 25, or 50 transactions per page
  - Navigate between pages with previous/next buttons
  - Display transaction count (e.g., "Showing 1 to 10 of 25 transactions")
- **Actions Menu** (three-dot menu icon):
  - üëÅÔ∏è View Details - Fetches and displays full transaction details from API
  - ‚úèÔ∏è Edit - Opens edit dialog with pre-filled data
  - üñ®Ô∏è Print Transaction - Prints transaction details
  - üóëÔ∏è Delete - Deletes transaction with confirmation
- **Color Coding**: Green for income, Red for expenses
- **Payment Method**: Displayed as outlined chip badges
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator while fetching transaction details

## Data Flow

### Creating a Transaction
1. User clicks "New Transaction" button
2. Dialog opens with empty form
3. User fills in transaction details
4. On submit, `addTransaction()` is called
5. API request is sent to backend
6. On success:
   - Transaction list is refreshed
   - Summary is refreshed
   - Dialog closes
   - Success message is shown
7. On error:
   - Error messages are displayed
   - Form remains open for correction

### Deleting a Transaction
1. User clicks "Delete" button on a transaction
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. On confirm, `deleteTransaction()` is called
4. API request is sent to backend
5. On success:
   - Transaction is removed from local state
   - Summary is refreshed
   - Success message is shown
6. On error:
   - Error message is displayed

### Loading Summary
- Summary is automatically loaded when component mounts
- Summary is refreshed after any transaction is added/updated/deleted
- Displays 0 values if API fails (graceful degradation)

## Error Handling

### API Level
- All API calls return consistent response format:
  ```javascript
  {
    success: boolean,
    data: any,
    error: string,
    fieldErrors: object,
    message: string
  }
  ```
- 403 (Forbidden) errors are handled silently, returning empty data
- Network errors show user-friendly messages

### Component Level
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- Field errors are displayed next to form inputs
- General errors are shown in Alert components
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions

## Security

### Authorization
- All requests include JWT token in Authorization header
- Backend validates user access to their own transactions only
- Frontend gracefully handles 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden) responses

### Validation
- Frontend validates required fields
- Backend performs additional validation
- Field errors are mapped and displayed appropriately

## Summary API

### Endpoint
`GET /api/accounting/summary`

### Response Format
```json
{
  "total_revenue": 125430,
  "total_expenses": 89210,
  "net_profit": 36220

```

### Frontend Mapping
The API returns snake_case keys which are automatically mapped to camelCase:
- `total_revenue` ‚Üí `totalRevenue`
- `total_expenses` ‚Üí `totalExpenses`
- `net_profit` ‚Üí `netProfit`

### Summary Cards
Three cards display at the top of the Accounting Department:

1. **Total Revenue** (Green card with TrendingUp icon)
   - Shows sum of all income transactions
   - Color: Success/Green
   
2. **Total Expenses** (Red card with AttachMoney icon)
   - Shows sum of all expense transactions
   - Color: Error/Red
   
3. **Net Profit** (Blue/Orange card with Assessment icon)
   - Calculated as: Revenue - Expenses
   - Color: Blue if positive, Orange if negative

### Reports Tab
Comprehensive financial reporting dashboard showing:

**Financial Summary**
- Large colored cards for Revenue, Expenses, and Net Profit
- Hover animation (cards lift on hover)

**Financial Breakdown Table**
- Income row with percentage (always 100%)
- Expense row with percentage of revenue
- Net Profit/Loss row with profit/loss indicator

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- **Profit Margin**: (Net Profit / Revenue) √ó 100
- **Expense Ratio**: (Expenses / Revenue) √ó 100
- **Total Transactions**: Count of all transactions
- **Average Transaction**: (Revenue + Expenses) / Transaction Count

**Report Info**
- Generation timestamp
- Real-time data indicator

## API Response Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Transactions Not Loading
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint is correct in `src/config/api.js`
3. Verify user token is valid
4. Check backend server is running
5. Verify user has access to Accounting department

### Cannot Create Transaction
1. Check all required fields are filled
2. Verify amount is a valid number
3. Check network tab for API response
4. Review field errors displayed on form

### Summary Shows Zero Values
1. Check if transactions exist
2. Verify summary API endpoint is working
