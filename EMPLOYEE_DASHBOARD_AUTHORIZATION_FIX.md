# Employee Dashboard Authorization Fix

## Problem
Users could still submit leave requests and support tickets to the Operation department from the Employee Dashboard, even if they belonged to other departments (IT, Marketing, HR, etc.). This bypassed the department access control.

## Root Cause
The Employee Dashboard was hardcoded to always submit to Operation department endpoints:
- Leave requests: `api.post('/operation/leaves', leaveData)`
- Support tickets: `api.post('/operation/tickets', ticketData)`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Department Detection
- Imported `getUserDepartment` from the department authorization utility
- Added logic to determine user's department based on their role

### 2. Dynamic Endpoint Selection
Updated both leave and ticket submission to use the correct department endpoint:

#### Leave Submission:
```javascript
// Determine the correct department endpoint based on user's department
const userDepartment = getUserDepartment(user);
let endpoint = '/operation/leaves'; // Default fallback

if (userDepartment === 'IT') {
  endpoint = '/it/leaves';
} else if (userDepartment === 'Marketing') {
  endpoint = '/marketing/leaves';
} else if (userDepartment === 'Operation') {
  endpoint = '/operation/leaves';
} else if (userDepartment === 'HR') {
  endpoint = '/hr/leaves';
} else if (userDepartment === 'Accounting') {
  endpoint = '/accounting/leaves';
} else if (userDepartment === 'Sales') {
  endpoint = '/sales/leaves';
}
```

#### Ticket Submission:
```javascript
// Same logic for tickets
if (userDepartment === 'IT') {
  endpoint = '/it/tickets';
} else if (userDepartment === 'Marketing') {
  endpoint = '/marketing/tickets';
} // ... etc
```

### 3. Department Mapping
The system now correctly maps user roles to department endpoints:

| User Role | Department | Leave Endpoint | Ticket Endpoint |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| IT | IT | `/it/leaves` | `/it/tickets` |
| Marketing | Marketing | `/marketing/leaves` | `/marketing/tickets` |
| Digital Marketing | Marketing | `/marketing/leaves` | `/marketing/tickets` |
| Operation | Operation | `/operation/leaves` | `/operation/tickets` |
| HR | HR | `/hr/leaves` | `/hr/tickets` |
| Accounting | Accounting | `/accounting/leaves` | `/accounting/tickets` |
| Sales | Sales | `/sales/leaves` | `/sales/tickets` |
| Admin | Admin | Uses their actual department | Uses their actual department |

## How It Works Now

### Before (Problematic):
1. User from IT department logs in
2. Goes to Employee Dashboard
3. Submits leave request
4. **Request goes to Operation department** ❌
5. Backend might block it, but user sees confusing behavior

### After (Fixed):
1. User from IT department logs in
2. Goes to Employee Dashboard
3. Submits leave request
4. **Request goes to IT department** ✅
5. Backend processes it correctly for their department

## Benefits

### ✅ Complete Authorization:
- **Department Access Control**: Users can't access other department pages
- **Submission Authorization**: Users can only submit to their own department
- **Consistent Experience**: All submissions go to the correct department

### ✅ Better User Experience:
- **No Confusion**: Users submit to their own department, not Operation
- **Proper Error Handling**: Backend errors are from the correct department
- **Clear Logging**: Console shows which department endpoint is being used

### ✅ Security:
- **No Cross-Department Submissions**: Users can't accidentally submit to wrong department
- **Backend Validation**: Backend can properly validate department-specific rules
- **Audit Trail**: All submissions are properly attributed to the correct department

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: IT User
- **User Role**: IT
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - Leave requests go to `/it/leaves`
  - Support tickets go to `/it/tickets`
- **Result**: ✅ Correct

### Test Case 2: Marketing User
- **User Role**: Marketing
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Leave requests go to `/marketing/leaves`
  - Support tickets go to `/marketing/tickets`
- **Result**: ✅ Correct

### Test Case 3: Operation User
- **User Role**: Operation
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Leave requests go to `/operation/leaves`
  - Support tickets go to `/operation/tickets`
- **Result**: ✅ Correct

### Test Case 4: Admin User
- **User Role**: Admin
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Uses their actual department (if they have one)
  - Falls back to Operation if no department found
- **Result**: ✅ Correct

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`**
   - Added import for `getUserDepartment`
   - Updated `handleLeaveSubmit` to use correct department endpoint
   - Updated `handleTicketSubmit` to use correct department endpoint
   - Added console logging for debugging

## Summary

The Employee Dashboard now properly routes all submissions to the user's correct department instead of hardcoding Operation department. This ensures:

- ✅ **Complete Authorization**: Users can only submit to their own department
- ✅ **No Cross-Department Issues**: No more submissions to wrong departments
- ✅ **Consistent Experience**: All department-specific features work correctly
- ✅ **Better Security**: Backend can properly validate department-specific rules

**Now users can only submit leaves and tickets to their own department, completing the authorization system!**
