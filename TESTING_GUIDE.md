## üéØ Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (First Time)
Use: **PRE_LAUNCH_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md**

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks before launch

**Steps**:
1. Print or open the comprehensive checklist
2. Assign sections to team members
3. Test systematically, section by section
4. Document all issues found
5. Fix critical and high-priority issues
6. Re-test fixed issues
7. Get stakeholder sign-off

**Recommended Team Distribution**:
- **QA Lead**: Sections 1-3, 11, 18-20 (Auth, RBAC, Notifications, Security, Errors)
- **Frontend Dev**: Sections 10, 15-17 (UI/UX, Performance, Responsive, Accessibility)
- **Backend Dev**: Sections 14 (API Integration & Data)
- **Department Leads**: Sections 4-9 (Their respective department modules)
- **Product Owner**: Sections 12-13, 21, 25 (Search/Filter, Forms, Integration, UAT)

### Phase 2: Daily Testing
Use: **QUICK_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md**

**Timeline**: Every day during development

**Steps**:
1. Run the 10-minute smoke test at start of day
2. Test specific modules you're working on
3. Run critical path tests before committing code
4. Document any new issues immediately

### Phase 3: Pre-Deployment
Use: **QUICK_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** + Critical sections of comprehensive checklist

**Timeline**: 30 minutes before every deployment

**Steps**:
1. Run complete quick testing checklist
2. Run build and check for errors
3. Test in staging environment
4. Verify API endpoints configured correctly
5. Check environment variables
6. Deploy only if all critical tests pass

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment
Use: **QUICK_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** (Production environment)

**Timeline**: Immediately after deployment + daily for first week

**Steps**:
1. Run smoke test in production
2. Monitor error logs
3. Check analytics for anomalies
4. Collect user feedback

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Testing Mistakes to Avoid

1. **‚ùå Don't skip role-based testing**
   - Test with each role, not just admin
   
2. **‚ùå Don't test only happy paths**
   - Test error scenarios, edge cases, invalid inputs
   
3. **‚ùå Don't forget to clear cache**
   - Use incognito mode or clear cache between tests
   
4. **‚ùå Don't ignore console errors**
   - Even warnings can indicate issues
   
5. **‚ùå Don't test in only one browser**
   - Browser compatibility is crucial
   
6. **‚ùå Don't forget mobile testing**
   - Many users will access from mobile
   
7. **‚ùå Don't test without network throttling**
   - Users may have slow connections
   
8. **‚ùå Don't skip security testing**
   - Try to bypass authorization, inject scripts
   
9. **‚ùå Don't forget to test offline behavior**
   - App should handle network errors gracefully
   
10. **‚ùå Don't assume backend validation**
    - Always verify frontend validation works

## üí° Tips for Efficient Testing

1. **Use shortcuts**: Learn keyboard shortcuts for browser DevTools
2. **Automate repetition**: Create scripts for repetitive setup tasks
3. **Keep notes**: Document as you test, not after
4. **Take breaks**: Testing for hours reduces accuracy
5. **Pair test**: Two sets of eyes catch more issues
6. **Use checklists**: Don't rely on memory
7. **Test systematically**: Don't jump around randomly
8. **Reproduce before reporting**: Ensure bug is reproducible
9. **One thing at a time**: Don't mix testing multiple features
10. **Stay organized**: Use issue tracking properly
